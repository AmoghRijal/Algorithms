# Algorithms

This project is a collection of different types (sorting, pathfinding, searching, pairing, etc..) of algorithms. Every algorithm is written in c++.

## Usage

To test the algorithms, navigate to the folder of algorithm you want to test. Compile the algorithm and run it using the following command:

```
g++ {filename}.cpp functions.cpp
```

Sorting algorithms take two lines of command line arguments:

```bash
Input:
Line 1 -> n -> number of elements of array to be sorted.
Line 2 -> n number of elements separate by space -> i.e 3 2 5 1 10

Output:
Sorted elements separate by space -> i.e 1 2 3 5 10
```

## Folder Structure

Contains files in specific folders grouped by the algorithm type.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
